# DS2023


Hi TA,
Unfortunately we did not have time to finish the assignment for this time, and so we obviously do not live up to the requirements.  
We also do not expect to pass this assignment, BUT we would like to receive some feedback on our approach currently, and what we can do to improve in the code, and also what we can do to get further in the system and technical requirements.



Run the server by specifying a port: 
go run Chitty-Chat/server/server.go -port someportnumber


Run the a client by specifying a client name and the same port as server:
go run Chitty-Chat/client/client.go -user someclientname -port someportnumber
